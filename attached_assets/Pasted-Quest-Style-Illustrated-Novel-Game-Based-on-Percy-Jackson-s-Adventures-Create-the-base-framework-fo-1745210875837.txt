Quest-Style Illustrated Novel Game Based on Percy Jackson’s Adventures

Create the base framework for an interactive, quest-style game inspired by Percy Jackson’s adventures. The game should be designed as a series of illustrated quests, each quest made up of multiple types of scenes, with built-in logic to handle story progression, branching paths, and player decisions.

General Structure:
The player begins as a regular camper at Camp Half-Blood.
As the player completes quests, they earn gems, magical powers, and weapons.
Each quest is a collection of scenes presented in the style of a graphic novel.
Each scene can have one or more illustrated panels.
Add placeholders for graphic art — they will be inserted later.
Scene Types:
1. Story Scenes

Purpose: Set the context, develop characters, or move the story forward.
Layout: 1 or more panels.
Interaction: Only an arrow button (or "Next") to proceed to the next panel.
2. Puzzle Scenes

Purpose: Challenge the player with a riddle or puzzle.
Layout: 1 panel.
Interaction: Display a riddle or puzzle question.
Provide a text input box for the player to type their answer.
On submission:
If correct: continue on a defined success path.
If incorrect: go to an alternate path.
3. Battle Scenes

Purpose: Turn-based combat between player and enemy.
Layout: Always 3 panels:
Panel 1: Player and enemy appear on the battlefield (placeholder for art).
Panel 2: Main battle interface.
Display player’s weapons and powers as cards on the side of the screen.
Allow the player to select and use them strategically against the enemy.
Enemy attacks or defends based on basic AI or pre-defined logic.
Panel 3: Show the outcome and transition.
If the player wins, move to a specific path.
If the player loses, move to an alternate path.
4. Decision/Choice Scenes

Purpose: Let the player make key choices that impact the story.
Layout: 1 panel showing a conversation or dramatic scene between the player and another character.
Interaction:
Display 2 or more choice boxes with different decisions.
When a choice is selected:
Continue to the corresponding path for that decision.
All choices lead to different outcomes (new scenes or quests).
Requirements:
Each quest and its scenes should be modular and easily extendable.
Scenes should include metadata for:
Type (Story, Puzzle, Battle, Decision)
Number of panels
Branching paths (next scene IDs or quest segments based on player actions)
Support saving player progress, inventory (gems, powers, weapons), and unlocked paths.
Graphic Elements:
Use placeholders or tags (e.g., <image_placeholder_scene_1_panel_2>) for all graphic art.
These will be manually replaced with illustrations later.
